       <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
       <p>This week I read the material on 10 mobile UX design principles, 
        introduction to web APIS and setTimeout and setInterval and took notes 
        on the material. I met with my team early and mid week to work on assignment 2 
        and also worked on my own to find a solution to fix the shopping cart issue.</p>
       <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2>
       <p>I will study more about async/await and about promises. This week we also had 
        some difficulties in moving forward with the assignment, but due to lack of knowledge 
        about the promises etc. We couldn't give you a quick solution</p>
       <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
       <p>Again as in the previous week I had to spend time researching to fix bugs in the code, 
        but it wasn't easy. You should also contact a tutor early in the week because it's hard to 
        get an appointment with any of them.</p>
