       <h2>What did I do since the last meeting?</h2>
       <p>This week I read the material on 10 mobile UX design principles, 
        introduction to web APIS and setTimeout and setInterval and took notes 
        on the material. I met with my team early and mid week to work on assignment 2 
        and also worked on my own to find a solution to fix the shopping cart issue.</p>
       <h2>What am I going to do next?</h2>
       <p>I will start by studying the readings at the beginning of the week and then I 
        will meet with my team to work on assignment 3. We will likely have to meet more 
        than once a week. I will also be studying more about javascript, probably spending 
        more time going through the resources provided by the instructor and also on my own, 
        since my team and I were unable to find a solution to the shopping cart issue.</p>
       <h2>What are my blockers?</h2>
       <p>It's been a year since I took the frontend development 1 class, so there are a few things
        about javascript that are not fresh in my memory, especially the information about objects.
        I believe that this lack of understanding has made it difficult for me to find a solution to the problems that
        they require prior knowledge, so I'll study more about that next week.</p>
